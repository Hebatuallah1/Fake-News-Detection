# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Elevvo Internship**.  
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that can classify news articles as **Real or Fake** based on their textual content.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess news titles and content (lowercasing, removing stopwords, cleaning text).
- Convert text into numerical format using **TF-IDF**.
- Train two classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluate models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**.
- Visualize results with **Confusion Matrices** and **WordClouds**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK (stopwords)  
- WordCloud  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

## 📊 Results
- Logistic Regression: ~**90% accuracy**  
- SVM Classifier: ~**92% accuracy**  
- WordClouds show the most frequent words in **Fake vs. Real News**.
